# ESP32 IoT Robotic Arm

Control a robotic arm with 3 joints remotely using the ESP32 microcontroller and the Arduino IoT Cloud platform. This project allows you to move the robotic arm's base, hand, and gripper through a simple cloud dashboard.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Remote Control**: Move the base, hand, and gripper using a web or mobile dashboard.
- **Arduino IoT Cloud Integration**: Real-time updates and easy access from anywhere.
- **Simple Wiring**: Just three servos and an ESP32 board.
- **Expandable**: Add more features or sensors as needed.

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

- **ESP32 Development Board** (e.g., ESP32 DevKit v1)
- **3x Servo Motors** (SG90 or MG90S recommended)
- **Robotic Arm Kit** (or custom 3D printed parts)
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard** (optional, for prototyping)
- **5V Power Supply** (for servos, recommended to power separately from ESP32)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Software & Libraries

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (latest version recommended)
- [Arduino IoT Cloud Account](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/)
- Please check if the Arduino Create Agent app is running in your device.
- **Libraries:**
  - `ESP32Servo` *(install from Library Manager)*
  - Arduino IoT Cloud libraries *(auto-installed when setting up the Thing)*

## 🚦 Arduino IoT Cloud Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your ESP32 robotic arm with the Arduino IoT Cloud: https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/guides/overview/

### 1. Create an Arduino IoT Cloud Account

- Go to [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/) and sign in or create an account.

### 2. Add Your Device

- Click on **Devices** in the sidebar.
- Select **Add Device** > **Set up a 3rd Party Device** > **ESP32**.
- Select the Board type (eg: 'ESP32 Dev Module' or 'DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1')

### 3. Create a New Thing

- Click on **Things** > **Create Thing**.
- Link your newly added ESP32 device to the Thing.

### 4. Add Variables (Cloud Properties)

Add the following variables (make sure to set the variable types and update permissions as shown):

| Name  | Variable Name | Type    | Update By | Description                |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|----------------------------|
| base  | `base`        | int     | Dashboard | Base rotation (0-180 deg)  |
| hand  | `hand`        | int     | Dashboard | Hand angle (0-180 deg)     |
| grip  | `grip`        | bool    | Dashboard | Gripper open/close (true/false) |

- For each variable, click **Add Variable**, fill details, and select the **on change** event trigger.

### 5. Configure the Dashboard

- Create a new dashboard and add widgets:
  - **Slider** for `base` (0-180)
  - **Slider** for `hand` (0-180)
  - **Switch/Toggle** for `grip`
- Link each widget to its corresponding variable.

### 6. Program the ESP32
DIRECT PROGRAMMING METHOD:
- The `.ino` and `thingProperties.h` files are respectively generated when the sketch for the the Thing is set up. **DO NOT EDIT THE** `thingProperties.h` **FILE.**
- Replace the main `.ino` file content with the provided `Robot_Arm.ino` sketch directly in the IoT cloud sketch tab.
- Install the `ESP32Servo` library via the Library Manager.
- Select the correct board and port in the setup tab.
- Upload the code to your ESP32.

DOWNLOAD CODE METHOD:
- Download the automatically generated `.ino` file and `thingProperties.h` from your Thing.
- Replace the main `.ino` file content with the provided `Robot_Arm.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.
- Make sure `thingProperties.h` is in your project folder. **(DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE)**
- Install the `ESP32Servo` library via the Library Manager.
- Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
- Upload the code to your ESP32.
